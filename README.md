# Gunpla scraper

Gunpla scraper is a python-written web scraper that gathers information about Gunpla (Gundam Plastic Models) from the Gundam fandom wiki.

# What is Gunpla ?

Gunpla is a portemanteau word for [Gundam Plastic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_model). These are plastic model kits representing bipedal war machines from the japanese media franchise [Gundam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam), created in 1979 by [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiyuki_Tomino). 

# About this project

Back in 2016, [CircuitFreak](https://github.com/circuitfreak/) created a gunpla API and wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@jorick.caberio/building-a-gunpla-api-using-python-selenium-phantomjs-and-firebase-e68143d3fd3c) about the web scraper used to gather information.

However, 5 years later, this API is no longer active. That's why I wanted to create a similar API, that will no longer limit itself to Master Grade Kits, but also to Real Grade, High Grade and other lines.
